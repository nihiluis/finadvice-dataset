I started a small business 6 years ago and at some point, opened up a TMobile account for a few TMobile hotspots that came in handy when I was traveling.  They were attached to my business credit card and auto-paid every month.

Then 2 years ago I sold the business to a larger company and I guess at some point the new company stopped paying those TMobile bills.  I imagine TMobile sent some alerts to my old business email or business mailing address, so I never received them.

Then as I’m applying for a short-term vacation rental this week, the agent let me know I have this hit on my personal credit report. 

What do I do? Do I contact TMobile? Or is there some collection agency that I now have to deal with? How do I make sure it’s removed?

Sorry to hear about the situation. It's essential to address this promptly to protect your credit and resolve any outstanding issues. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you can do:

Obtain a Copy of Your Credit Report: Before you take any action, get a copy of your credit report from all three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). This will give you a clear picture of the issue and any other potential problems.

Contact T-Mobile:

Start by reaching out to T-Mobile's customer service. Explain the situation and ask about the status of the account. They should be able to provide details about the debt, including when it was sent to collections.
If the debt is still with T-Mobile and hasn't been sold to a collection agency, you might be able to negotiate directly with them. They may offer a payment plan or even a reduced amount to settle the debt.
Collection Agency:

If the debt has been sold to a collection agency, T-Mobile should provide you with their contact information.
When dealing with collection agencies, always communicate in writing and keep copies of all correspondence. This will help if there are any disputes later on.
You can negotiate with the collection agency. Sometimes they'll accept a lower amount to settle the debt. If you do negotiate a settlement, get the agreement in writing before making a payment.
Pay the Debt: If the debt is legitimate and you're responsible for it, the best course of action is to pay it off. This won't immediately remove the negative mark from your credit report, but it will show as "Paid" or "Settled," which is better than an outstanding collection.

Dispute the Debt (if necessary):

If you believe the debt isn't yours or there's an error, you can dispute it with the credit bureaus.
Provide any evidence you have, such as proof of sale of the business or any agreement that the new company would take over the bills.
The credit bureau will investigate the dispute, usually within 30 days. If they find in your favor, the negative mark will be removed from your credit report.
Goodwill Letter: If you've paid off the debt but the negative mark remains on your credit report, you can write a goodwill letter to TMobile or the collection agency. In the letter, explain the situation and request that they remove the negative mark from your credit report out of goodwill. There's no guarantee this will work, but it's worth a try, especially if you had a good payment history before the oversight.

Monitor Your Credit: After resolving the issue, regularly check your credit report to ensure no other discrepancies arise and to confirm that the negative mark has been addressed.

Seek Legal or Financial Counseling: If you're unsure about any steps or feel overwhelmed, consider seeking advice from a financial counselor or attorney who specializes in credit issues.

Remember, the key is to act quickly and keep records of all your communications. Addressing the issue head-on will give you the best chance of resolving it in your favor.

The first thing you should do is to get a copy of your credit report from a reputable credit reporting agency. This will allow you to see exactly what is on your report, including any unpaid bills or collections.

Once you have a copy of your report, you should contact T-Mobile to discuss the situation. You can explain that you sold the business and thought the new owners would continue paying the bills. If T-Mobile has sent the debt to a collection agency, they should be able to tell you which one.

You can then contact the collection agency to discuss the situation. They may be able to remove the hit from your credit report if you pay the debt in full. If the debt is not yours, you can dispute it with the collection agency and ask them to provide proof that you owe the money. If they can't do this, they are required to remove the debt from your credit report.

If the debt is yours and you can't pay it in full, you may be able to negotiate a payment plan or a reduced payment to settle the debt. Once the debt is paid or settled, the collection agency should update your credit report to reflect this.

You may also want to consult with a credit repair company or a lawyer who specializes in credit repair to help you navigate this process. They can provide advice and assistance in dealing with the collection agency and getting the hit removed from your credit report. 

Remember, it's important to keep all correspondence with T-Mobile, the collection agency, and any credit repair company or lawyer. This will help you to keep track of what has been said and done, and may be useful if you need to dispute the debt or the hit on your credit report in the future.

Switching from monthly mortgage payments to weekly or biweekly payments can indeed have an impact on your loan's amortization and the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. Making more frequent payments can help you pay off your loan faster and save on interest. To help you with this, you can use an online mortgage amortization calculator.

Here's how you can use such a tool:

    Find an Online Calculator: There are numerous online mortgage amortization calculators available. You can search for terms like "biweekly mortgage calculator" or "weekly mortgage payment calculator" to find one that suits your needs.

    Enter Loan Details: Once you've found a calculator, you'll need to input details such as the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and start date of the loan.

    Choose Payment Frequency: Most calculators will allow you to choose different payment frequencies, such as monthly, biweekly, or weekly. Select the frequency you're considering switching to.

    Input Additional Payments: Some calculators also allow you to input additional payments. This can be useful if you plan to make extra payments periodically.

    Calculate Results: After you've entered all the relevant information, the calculator will provide you with details about how your payments will change based on the new frequency. It should show you the total interest paid, the loan payoff date, and other relevant information.

    Compare Results: With the information provided, you can compare the total interest paid and the loan payoff date for different payment frequencies. This will help you understand how much you can potentially save by switching to biweekly or weekly payments.

Remember that while more frequent payments can save you money on interest in the long run, there might be some administrative costs associated with changing your payment frequency. Also, make sure that your lender supports the payment frequency you're interested in before making any changes.

If you're uncertain about the calculations or need personalized advice, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or mortgage specialist. They can provide you with guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### GPT4
Switching from monthly to weekly or biweekly payments can be a great way to reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of your mortgage. This is because you'll be making more frequent payments, which means the principal balance of your loan decreases faster, leading to less interest accrued.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you compare the differences:

Understand the Basics:

Monthly Payments: 12 payments per year.
Biweekly Payments: 26 half-monthly payments or 13 full monthly payments per year. This means you're essentially making one extra monthly payment per year.
Weekly Payments: 52 quarter-monthly payments or 13 full monthly payments per year.
Find an Amortization Tool:

Online Calculators: There are many online mortgage calculators that allow you to input different payment frequencies. A quick search for "biweekly mortgage calculator" or "weekly mortgage calculator" should yield plenty of results.
Excel/Google Sheets: You can create or download an amortization template for Excel or Google Sheets. This gives you more flexibility to customize the calculations and compare different scenarios side by side.
Input Your Loan Details:

Principal amount
Interest rate
Term of the loan (e.g., 30 years)
Desired payment frequency (monthly, biweekly, weekly)
Analyze the Results:

Look at the total interest paid over the life of the loan for each payment frequency.
Check how much sooner you'd pay off the mortgage with more frequent payments.
Consider any fees or penalties associated with changing your payment frequency.
Other Considerations:

Before making a change, check with your lender to ensure they accept biweekly or weekly payments without penalties.
Some lenders might not apply biweekly payments immediately but instead hold onto them until they have the full monthly amount. This would negate the benefits of biweekly payments, so it's essential to clarify this with your lender.
Consider setting up automatic payments to ensure consistency.
Alternative Approach:
If your lender doesn't offer a biweekly payment option or if they don't apply payments immediately, you can achieve a similar effect by dividing your monthly mortgage payment by 12 and adding that amount to each monthly payment. This way, you're making an extra payment each year, which will reduce your principal faster and save on interest.

Remember, while paying off your mortgage faster can save on interest, it's also essential to consider other financial goals and ensure you have a well-rounded financial plan.
